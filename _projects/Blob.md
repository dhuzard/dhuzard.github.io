## About The Blob

It was a fun experiment, playing around with this amazing organism.

For anything Blob related, I just recommend reading and watching the research or content created by **Audrey Dussutour**.
[Youtube video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVhIKKWb9o&ab_channel=IdeasinScience).

Also, just a quick question I have, that is still unanswered, to my current knowledge: The blob can 'learn' and share that learning, in term of 'taste preference'. But I think the demonstration is to show that, the Blob exposed to a specific (initially reppealing) chemical, will then teach another blob its taste, so the newly formed blob will also have that test. but to me, it sound more like a dilutional effect, in which the internal composition of the 'Learner' gets diluted when mixed with the second blob, making the transmission of chemical compound 'habituation'.
