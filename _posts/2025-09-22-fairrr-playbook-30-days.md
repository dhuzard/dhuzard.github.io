This is Post 5 of 5 in the FAIRRR series. Previous: [Case Study—HCM with MAPP + Ontology Mapping](/Blog/case-study-hcm-mapp-ontology/)

## Week 1 — Scope and minimal descriptors

- Pick one ongoing study; list 10–15 ARRIVE‑aligned descriptors.
- Assign persistent IDs (animals, devices, protocols, reagents).
- Define roles and review cadence.

## Week 2 — Templates and capture in‑flow

- Configure MAPP templates for your study.
- Map 10 core ontology terms for behaviors/conditions.
- Start capturing provenance and deviations as you go.

## Week 3 — Link a pipeline and export

- Connect one analysis pipeline; record versions and parameters.
- Export a reusable package (metadata + license) for internal review.
- Dry‑run repository submission if relevant.

## Week 4 — Review, publish, and institutionalize

- FAIRRR scorecard review; close gaps.
- Write an SOP addendum for metadata and provenance.
- Present quick wins to leadership (time saved, joins enabled, duplication avoided).

## Sustaining practices

- Quarterly FAIRRR metrics; template updates.
- Rotating metadata champions; refresher training.
- Incremental integrations (LIMS/ELN, more pipelines, repositories).

## What success looks like in 30 days

- One study with end‑to‑end FAIRRR metadata in MAPP.
- A working integration with at least one analysis.
- An SOP addendum and a simple FAIRRR dashboard.
