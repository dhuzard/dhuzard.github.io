# Turn an Article into a LinkedIn Post

Ever struggled to condense a dense paper into 150 words that catch attention on LinkedIn? I built a little **LiPT** (LinkedIn Post Technician) to do exactly that — feed it your abstract (or any scientific article), and it spits out a polished LinkedIn post ready to publish. I demo’d it in my recent science-communication webinar — watch the video below to see it in action!

👉 **[Watch the demo video here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z8Fndmj92WHmR_ew2-s4KeVwFL6f1Nza/view?usp=drive_link)**

## Why It Matters

Researchers and industry pros often pour months into a study — then struggle to share it beyond their peers. A concise, engaging LinkedIn post can:

🚀 Boost your work’s visibility  
🔗 Drive traffic to your paper or preprint  
🤝 Spark cross-disciplinary conversations  

## How the Demo Works

0. **LiPT** [Click HERE](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-tRXKd0Sip-lipt-likedin-posttechnician)
1. **Input:** Paste your abstract or link to the full paper.  
2. **Settings:** Choose tone (formal, friendly) or specify emojis.  
3. **Generate:** The GPT model returns a draft post under 150 words, complete with hook, bullets, and hashtags. 
4. **Proof Read and Validate** The most important step is to read and reformualte the post! Do not forget: You are responsible for what you are sharing after using LLM to provide a draft!

## Behind the Scenes: The Prompt

Want to try it yourself with any LLM tool (GPT-4, Claude, Mistral, Gemini, etc.)? Copy and paste the prompt below 👇

Objective: Craft a high-engagement LinkedIn post for scientists in academia or industry.

[Guidelines]
Text Formatting: Avoid bold text or asterisks.
Emojis: Use 1–3 relevant emojis to enhance readability and convey emotion.
Length: Aim less than 150 words. Ensure the first 200 characters contain a compelling hook and the main benefit.
Sentences: Use short, clear sentences for better readability.
Hashtags: Include 3–5 relevant hashtags at the end of the post, mixing broad and niche tags.
External Links: Put any external URL in the first comment (mention it in the text). Give (or ask if not provided) the link and instruction to post it in the first comment.

[Structure]
Headline: Craft a headline with ≤10 words, using a question or strong verb to capture attention.
Introduction: Provide context and explain why the topic matters in 2 sentences.
Key Insights: Present main findings using bullet points for clarity.
Implications: Explain the significance of these findings for the field in 1–2 sentences.
Personal Opinion: Share my perspective, linking it to my behavioral and data expertise. Express genuine enthusiasm, using 1–2 appropriate emojis.
Call to Action: Encourage readers to comment, share, or read more.
Hashtags: Add 3–5 relevant hashtags at the end.

Optional image: if asked, generate a data-centric professional illustration (muted colours, realistic lighting).

## Watch & Try It Yourself

Head to the video above to see a live run-through, then copy the prompt into your LLM of choice. Within seconds, you’ll have a LinkedIn-ready post that highlights your work without drowning in jargon.
