Here I'm, advertising myself and sharing the fact that I am currently looking for a science Job (and probably not in academia anymore…)

After 10 years in **preclinical behavioral research**, I’ve decided to transition from academia to industry. But let me be clear: **my science journey isn’t over**! My path in science hasn’t been easy, and I don’t want to risk losing my passion by staying in a system that no longer aligns with my values. I’m as passionate about neuroscience as ever; I just want to contribute in a different environment and in a way that feels more sustainable for me.

My background includes multidisciplinary project management, behavioral neuroscience, neurodevelopmental disorders, physiology and metabolism, and social behaviors in homecage monitoring systems. I’m also experienced in science communication, leadership, advanced data analysis, Python coding, and applying ML/AI tools in research.

I’m looking for roles where I can **continue to contribute to neuroscience**: whether that’s as a Consultant, Senior Scientist, Project (or R&D) Lead, Data Scientist, Product Manager, Research Strategist, or Innovation Specialist. I am motivated by being involved in **innovative and impactful projects that drive scientific progress**.

If you read this and have any advice, leads, or opportunities to share with me, please Contact Me ! Or if you fill like sharing my journey within your networks, it would mean a lot to me.

Thank you in advance for your help and support!
