This is Post 2 of 5 in the FAIRRR series. Previous: [The Metadata Gap Is an Ethics Gap](/Blog/fairrr-ethics-of-metadata/) • Next: [Inside MAPP—API‑First FAIRRR](/Blog/mapp-api-first-fairrr/)

## FAIR for animal research

- Findable: unique IDs for animals, studies, protocols; rich searchable metadata.
- Accessible: standard protocols and clear access rules; durable links.
- Interoperable: shared ontologies and identifiers; qualified references.
- Reusable: provenance, licenses, and community standards.

## The 3Rs lens on metadata

- Replacement: comparable context reveals viable non‑animal models.
- Reduction: reuse across studies avoids duplication; pooled analyses.
- Refinement: transparent deviations and environment details improve welfare.

## Minimal viable standards (practical set)

- ARRIVE‑aligned descriptors for study design and reporting.
- Persistent identifiers for animals, devices, reagents, and protocols.
- Ontologies for behaviors, anatomy, conditions, procedures, and reagents.
- Provenance (who/what/when/where/how), versions, and deviations.
- Licenses and reuse terms.

## Metrics you can track

- Time‑to‑reuse: first external reuse after publication/export.
- Duplication avoided: studies averted via comparable prior data.
- Cross‑study joins: number of successful joins across cohorts/devices.
- Protocol deviations: detection rate and resolution time.
- Provenance completeness: % of records with full lineage and versions.
- FAIRRR score: a simple rubric (0–100) across F‑A‑I‑R + 3Rs facets.

## Overcoming the usual barriers

- Culture: position metadata as quality and ethics, not bureaucracy.
- UX: capture in‑flow (APIs and templates), not at the end.
- Governance: roles, reviews, and versioned templates.
- Interop: API‑first integration with ELN/LIMS and analysis pipelines.

## How this maps to MAPP

MAPP bakes these practices into templates, identifiers, ontologies, and APIs, and exposes exports for repositories and reviewers. That makes FAIRRR measurable—not aspirational.
