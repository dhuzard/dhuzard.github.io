## The hidden cost of “good enough” metadata

Most labs still rely on scattered spreadsheets, email attachments, and post‑hoc documentation. The result is irreproducible work, duplicated experiments, and animals used without maximizing knowledge gain. That isn’t just a technical problem—it’s an ethics problem.

FAIRRR reframes metadata management as a scientific and ethical responsibility: data should be Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable—and the way we manage it should honor the 3Rs (Replacement, Reduction, Refinement) while enabling innovative, reproducible, and responsible research.

## From FAIR to FAIRRR

- FAIR makes data usable beyond a single lab or study.
- FAIRRR adds explicit responsibility for animal welfare and scientific rigor.
- The link: better metadata enables fewer repeated studies, more reuse, and clearer evidence for humane alternatives.

## Where reproducibility actually breaks

- Planning: no shared identifiers for protocols, animals, devices, reagents.
- Capture: context is lost (who/what/when/where/how), especially deviations.
- Lineage: data aren’t linked to analysis versions and parameters.
- Sharing: metadata are added at publication—too late for quality or reuse.

## A simple lifecycle you can manage

Plan → Capture → Link → Publish → Reuse.

- Plan: define minimal descriptors and identifiers (ARRIVE‑aligned).
- Capture: log procedures, animals, devices, behaviors as you go.
- Link: connect to pipelines and provenance (inputs, versions, outputs).
- Publish: export a reusable package with licenses and ontology terms.
- Reuse: enable cross‑study joins and meta‑analysis.

## How MAPP operationalizes FAIRRR

MAPP is an API‑first platform for preclinical metadata. It standardizes capture (procedures, animals, devices, behaviors), enforces identifiers and ontologies, links analyses, and exports structured, machine‑readable packages. In short, it turns scattered records into shareable, computable context.

What that means ethically:

- Replacement: discover suitable alternatives faster via findable, comparable studies.
- Reduction: avoid duplication; enable pooled analyses and cross‑study reuse.
- Refinement: expose protocol context and deviations to improve quality and welfare.
